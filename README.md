#ChangingRoom
####A Firefox Add-on to help you find relevant clothing faster.

###About
When shopping around the internet, It can sometimes become a little overwhelming being presented with so many links, categories and sub-categories for items that you could buy.

###Usage
After install, You tell ChangingRoom whether you'd like to see products for men or products for women, then on every page load ChangingRoom will look at the content of the page and work out whether or not there is a page on the site that would better suit your needs based on your preferences. If so, we'll take you straight there, if not then you're free to browse around as normal.

All of this happens in the background, after setting your preferences, you won't need to interact with ChangingRoom again.
